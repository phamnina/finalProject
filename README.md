Write a short paragraph describing your project.  This should include the purpose of the program as well as how it works.
	Our project is a relaxing beach scene.In our program, we have clouds, palm trees, beach chairs and a moving crab. 	Right away when you run the program the sun sets. When you mouse press the program it changes from a sunset scene to day 	and the sun comes back up.
	
Describe the section of the program for which you had the main responsibility and briefly describe your successes and difficulties.  How did you overcome these problems?
	Overall we worked together throughout the whole project. Some dificulties we had where when we set our backgronf to an ombre color, the sun and crab moved a lot slower than we wanted. Honestly, a big sucess for us was just getting it done. We did not expect our scene to look as good as it did, but we are very proud of our work.
	
Write a short paragraph describing your group.  Topics to discuss include but are not limited to:  1) Group dynamics;   2) Group “leader”;   3) Give each member of your group a participation and effort percentage.  The total percentage will equal 100%.  Include your own effort; 4) Include any other information about your group that will help me award each member an equitable grade for the project.
	We worked in a collective way. Nina will start something and yaz will finish it or vice versa. There was no group leader we both contributed equally. We finish each other like a puzzle. When one doesn’t know how to do something, chances are the other will. Nina:50% Yaz: 50%. 
	
Reflection:  On the back of this sheet, write a brief paragraph or two reflecting your year in AP Computer Science.  Include things you enjoyed about the course, things that you would like to see revised, how well prepared for the AP exam you were, your greatest achievement, and your feelings about this final project.  You may frame it as a letter to next year’s incoming AP students.
	Our favorite thing about the class was lab days. We liked being able to go to the lab and working on things at our own pace. We both did not take the AP test, but we both thought this class was a good and refreshing way to be introduced to the world of comp sci. Projects were fun becuase you got to be creative in your own way and every project was unique. Our greatest achievement was this project. We finally got it together enough to create something fairly beautiful. This project was fun. It was nice to not have too many requirements, so we could be crreative in our own ways.
